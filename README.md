Volunteer_Website is a project made for Coding Solution.

Project Goal:
Many Community groups organize service projects such as cleanup, donations, painting, and landscaping, but a number of these groups donâ€™t have coordinating software to manage these projects. Instead, they coordinate via email and phone. This app is a lightweight solution available for any group to use and offers public visibility of a volunteer project to spread their influence. Users can post projects and details or view projects to select one to attend.
